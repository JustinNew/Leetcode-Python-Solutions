Python For Leetcode
==========

### How to solve a coding problem well:
  - Understand the problem well
  - Solve the problem on paper
  - Form clear logic
  - Turn the solution into code
  - Think about the test cases
  - Do the test cases for the code to test code

### Dynamic Programming

  - Problems can be solved like F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
  
There are three ways to do Dynamic Programming: 
  - Backtracking: recursively solving the problem
  - Top-down dynamic programming: build a memoization table to reduce computation, a way to optimize backtracking.
  - Bottom-up dynamic programming: top-down to bottom-up conversion is done by eliminating recursion.
  - A good example: https://leetcode.com/articles/jump-game/

Example problems:
- 62 Unique Paths
  
### Greedy

  - Problems can be solved like maxReach = max(maxReach, i+x), where i+x is current reach.
  
Example problems:
- 55 Jump Game

### Linked List

  - Remember to use Dummy Head Node to make life easier.

### Array/List problems

Trick
  - Two pointers
  - One or Two extra help arrays/lists
